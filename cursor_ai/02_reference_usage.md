# üß† 02 ‚Äî Giving Context and References in Cursor

Cursor isn‚Äôt just a code suggester ‚Äî it understands your **project context**. But to get the best results, you should guide it with the right references.

This short guide covers how to give effective context when asking questions or requesting edits.

---

## üß© Option 1: Select Code First

**Best for:** focused edits or questions about a specific block.

1. Select the function, class, or block you want help with
2. Press `Cmd + I` (Mac) / `Ctrl + I` (Win/Linux)
3. Enter a prompt like:

   > ‚ÄúAdd logging and type hints‚Äù
   >
   > ‚ÄúMake this class async-compatible‚Äù

Cursor will only consider the selected code, so this keeps the response accurate and fast.

## üìÅ Option 2: Whole File AI Edit

**Best for:** refactors, documentation, or broad changes.

1. Open the file
2. Press `Cmd + A` to select all (or manually select)
3. Then `Cmd + I` or right-click ‚Üí ‚ÄúEdit with AI‚Äù

Prompt examples:

> ‚ÄúRefactor for readability and add docstrings‚Äù
> 
> ‚ÄúFix deprecated code for Python 3.12‚Äù

## üîó Option 3: Chat with Cross-File Context

**Best for:** understanding how pieces connect across the project.

Use the AI Sidebar (üí¨ icon or `Cmd + K`)

Prompt examples:

> ‚ÄúWhere is `get_user_permissions()` used in this project?‚Äù
> 
> ‚ÄúExplain how data flows from `routes/api.py` to `services/user.py`‚Äù
> 
> ‚ÄúWhat does the overall auth flow look like?‚Äù

Cursor will consider multiple files at once, not just the one you‚Äôre viewing.

## üß† Smart Referencing Tips

* üìå **Be explicit about filenames** when needed

  > ‚ÄúThis function is in `utils.py`, but used in `main.py`‚Äù

* üîç **Use natural phrases like:**

  > ‚ÄúIn this repo‚Ä¶‚Äù
  > 
  > ‚ÄúAcross the service layer‚Ä¶‚Äù
  > 
  > ‚ÄúBetween these files‚Ä¶‚Äù

* üìÇ **Ask for overviews:**

  > ‚ÄúSummarize how the app starts up and initializes services‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Scenario                         | Best Reference Strategy       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Simple function/class            | Select code + `Cmd + I`       |
| Full file edit or transformation | Select file + `Cmd + I`       |
| Questions across files           | Use sidebar chat (`Cmd + K`)  |
| Project-level explanation        | Use broad prompts via sidebar |
