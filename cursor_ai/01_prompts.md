# 🧠 01 — Writing Effective Prompts in Cursor

Cursor works best when you talk to it like a developer assistant. Here are the most useful types of prompts to use:

---

## 🧩 Understanding Code

> "What does this function do?"  
> 
> "Explain the flow of this file"  
> 
> "Summarize how the main class works"

---

## 🧪 Writing Tests

> "Write pytest unit tests for this function"  
> 
> "Generate tests for edge cases"  
> 
> "Add integration tests for this FastAPI endpoint"

---

## ♻️ Refactoring Code

> "Refactor to smaller functions"  
> 
> "Convert this to a class-based approach"  
> 
> "Make this code more Pythonic"  
> 
> "Apply the Single Responsibility Principle"

---

## 🛠️ Fixing or Improving Code

> "Fix this for Python 3.12 compatibility"  
> 
> "Improve performance"  
> 
> "Catch possible exceptions and handle them"

---

## 📄 Documentation Prompts

> "Add docstrings to all functions"  
> 
> "Generate markdown docs for this file"  
> 
> "Explain how this API endpoint works"

---

## ✨ Style and Cleanup

> "Sort and format imports with ruff-style rules" 
>  
> "Rename variables for clarity"  
> 
> "Apply consistent naming conventions"

## 💡 Prompting Tips

- Be specific, but natural — talk to it like a teammate
- Include what you want: tests, style, architecture, etc.
- You can combine tasks:  
  > “Refactor and add docstrings to this file”
- Use `Cmd + I` after selecting a code block or file for best results
