# üìà 03 ‚Äî Productivity Tips for Using Cursor

Cursor shines when you make it part of your daily coding workflow. These tips and tricks will help you get faster, cleaner results with less effort.

## ‚ö° Use AI Shortcuts

* `Cmd + K` (Mac) / `Ctrl + K` (Win/Linux): **Edit selected code with AI**
  Use this for quick, inline improvements and refactors.

* `Cmd + I` (Mac) / `Ctrl + I` (Win/Linux): **Open the AI sidebar**
  Use this for chat-based interactions, cross-file reasoning, and referencing other files with `@`.

* `Cmd + Shift + P` ‚Üí type ‚ÄúAI‚Äù: Access AI actions via the Command Palette

> üí° Cursor's sidebar (`Cmd/Ctrl + I`) can understand and act on your full project context, not just the selected code.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Comment-Driven Prompts

You can guide Cursor using inline comments in your code:

```python
# ai: optimize this function
# ai: add type hints and docstring
```

Then select the code and press `Cmd + K` / `Ctrl + K` to let Cursor act on the comment as a natural-language instruction.

> üí° This is great for consistent edits and automating small cleanup tasks.

## üß≠ Use `@` to Reference Other Files or Folders

When using the **AI sidebar** (`Cmd/Ctrl + I`), you can reference specific files or directories using `@`.

Examples:

> ‚ÄúRefactor this function using `@utils/formatters.py` as a guide‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúAdd logging similar to what's used in `@shared/logger.py`‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúRewrite based on schema in `@schemas/user.py`‚Äù

This is especially useful for making consistent changes across a codebase.

## üîÅ Combine Tasks in One Prompt

Cursor handles **multi-part prompts** well. Save time by combining instructions.

Examples:

> ‚ÄúRefactor for readability and add type hints‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúImprove performance and include logging‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúConvert this to async and write docstrings‚Äù

## üß™ Use Cursor to Review Your Own Code

Before committing, you can ask Cursor to help check for common issues.

Examples:

> ‚ÄúAre any edge cases missing in this function?‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúIs there unreachable or repeated logic?‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúWould this scale to 10x the data volume?‚Äù

Think of it as an intelligent pre-commit reviewer.

## üß† Suggested Workflow Loop

1. üîç **Start in the sidebar** (`Cmd/Ctrl + I`): Ask high-level questions
2. ‚úçÔ∏è **Zoom in with inline edits** (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`): Focus on specific blocks
3. üí¨ **Follow up in sidebar**: Ask clarifying or improvement questions

This loop helps you go from concept ‚Üí code ‚Üí polish, efficiently.

## üöÄ Bonus: Combine with External Tools

You can combine Cursor prompts with your existing toolchain:

* **Ruff formatting**

  > ‚ÄúMake this compliant with Ruff rules‚Äù

* **Black-style formatting**

  > ‚ÄúFormat this file using Black‚Äôs style guide‚Äù

* **FastAPI/Django integration**

  > ‚ÄúCreate endpoints using the schema in `@schemas/user.py`‚Äù
  > ‚ÄúAdd Pydantic validation and docstrings to this route‚Äù
