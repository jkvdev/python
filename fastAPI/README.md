# FastAPI Onboarding Project

This repository documents my learning journey with FastAPI as part of my onboarding at Barkibu. The goal is to build a small, functional FastAPI application while capturing key concepts and best practices along the way.

---

## Project Overview

The project is divided into three main parts:

- **General README (this file):** Explains the project goals, structure, and how to get started.
- **Notes folder (`/notes`):** A collection of detailed markdown notes covering FastAPI concepts, design decisions, and useful references.
- **Project folder (`/project`):** Contains the actual FastAPI application code, including API endpoints, models, schemas, and tests.

## Objectives

- Gain hands-on experience with FastAPI fundamentals: routing, validation, dependency injection, error handling.
- Explore FastAPI features such as automatic API docs, request/response models, and background tasks.
- Practice writing clean, modular, and testable code.
- Create clear documentation to explain concepts and decisions for future reference.
- Build confidence in deploying and maintaining Python web APIs.

---

## Getting Started

1. Set up a Python virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies listed in `project/requirements.txt`.
3. Run the FastAPI development server using Uvicorn.
4. Explore the API via Swagger UI at `/docs`.
5. Review notes in the `/notes` folder for detailed explanations.
6. Extend the API and update notes accordingly.

## Future Enhancements

- Add authentication and authorization.
- Implement database integration.
- Include more comprehensive testing strategies.
- Document advanced FastAPI features and performance tuning.
