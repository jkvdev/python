# 🧠 LangGraph: Declarative State Machines for LLM Workflows

**LangGraph** is an extension to LangChain that lets you build **stateful, branching workflows** using **graph-based logic**. It's ideal for scenarios where decisions depend on previous outputs, user input, or looping behavior.

---

## 🎯 Why Use LangGraph?

- Define workflows with multiple branching steps  
- Control flow explicitly (e.g., loop, conditionals, end states)  
- Visualize and debug complex agent or data-processing logic  
- Use for multi-modal, multi-agent, or multi-step pipelines

## 🧱 LangGraph Concepts

| Concept        | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Node**       | A step in your graph (e.g., a prompt or function)|
| **Edge**       | A transition from one node to another            |
| **Graph**      | A full pipeline of nodes and edges               |
| **State**      | Dict-like object passed through steps            |

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
pip install langgraph
```

## 🧪 Basic Example: Simple LangGraph Chain

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langgraph.graph.schema import TypedState
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda

# Define your state shape
class MyState(TypedState):
    question: str
    answer: str = None

# Define steps (nodes)
def ask_llm(state: MyState) -> MyState:
    question = state["question"]
    # Simulate an LLM call
    state["answer"] = f"The answer to '{question}' is 42."
    return state

# Create LangGraph
graph = StateGraph(MyState)
graph.add_node("ask", RunnableLambda(ask_llm))
graph.set_entry_point("ask")
graph.add_edge("ask", END)            # Define end transition explicitly
graph.set_finish_point(END)

# Compile
runnable = graph.compile()

# Invoke
result = runnable.invoke({"question": "What is the meaning of life?"})
print(result["answer"])  # The answer to 'What is the meaning of life?' is 42.
```

---

## 🔁 Conditional Branching

You can direct the graph based on model outputs or logic:

```python
def router(state):
    if "weather" in state["question"].lower():
        return "weather_handler"
    return "default_handler"

graph.add_conditional_edges("router", router)

# 🔄 Don't forget to recompile after modifying graph structure
runnable = graph.compile()
```

---

## 🔄 Looping Example

Use `graph.add_edge("stepA", "stepB")` to define flow.
To loop:

```python
graph.add_edge("check", "stepA")  # Add conditional edge to loop
```

Use flags or counters in your state to implement a stopping condition.

> 🔄 Remember: Call `graph.compile()` again after making structural changes.

## 🧠 Use Cases for LangGraph

* **Multi-step agents** (e.g., research → analyze → summarize)
* **AutoGPT-style planning** with feedback loops
* **Complex data pipelines** (e.g., parse → enrich → store)
* **Multi-modal agents** (e.g., image → text → classify)

---

## ✅ Summary

* **LangGraph** models workflows using graphs and states
* Nodes are logic units (prompts, functions, tools)
* Edges define flow of logic (including branches and loops)
* Use it to build advanced, declarative LLM pipelines
