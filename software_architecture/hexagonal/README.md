# Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) in Python

Hexagonal Architecture ‚Äî also known as the **Ports and Adapters** pattern ‚Äî is a way of structuring software that makes your **core application logic** independent from frameworks, databases, and external tools.

This means your app becomes more **testable**, **adaptable**, and **clean**.

---

## üåü Why Use Hexagonal Architecture?

Traditional applications often follow a layered architecture where frameworks like FastAPI, ORMs, and other dependencies leak into the core business logic. Over time, this leads to:

- üíî Tight coupling to frameworks  
- üòµ Hard-to-test domain logic  
- üö´ Fragile and hard-to-maintain code  

Hexagonal architecture solves this by **inverting dependencies** and organizing your code around **use cases**, not technologies.

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ports**             | Abstract interfaces that define how your app communicates |
| **Adapters**          | Concrete implementations of those ports                   |
| **Application Core**  | Business logic ‚Äî clean, decoupled, testable               |
