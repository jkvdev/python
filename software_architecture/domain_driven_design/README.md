# 🧭 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on modeling software based on the real-world business domain. It aims to create a shared understanding between developers and domain experts and structures code to reflect domain logic clearly and explicitly.

DDD is especially useful for complex applications and promotes maintainable, flexible, and testable code.

## 🔐 Key Concepts

### 01. Entity
An object that has a unique identity and persists over time. Its identity is what distinguishes it, not its attributes.

- See: [`01_entities.md`](./01_entities.md)

---

### 02. Value Object
An object that is defined by its attributes and has no identity. It is immutable and interchangeable with other objects having the same values.

- See: [`02_value_objects.md`](./02_value_objects.md)

---

### 03. Aggregate
A cluster of entities and value objects that are treated as a single unit. One entity acts as the root and controls access to the rest.

- See: [`03_aggregates.md`](./03_aggregates.md)

---

### 04. Repository
A mechanism for accessing and storing aggregates. It abstracts away persistence logic to provide a clean interface to the domain.

- See: [`04_repositories.md`](./04_repositories.md)

---

### 05. Domain Service
A stateless service that performs domain logic not naturally fitting into an entity or value object.

- See: [`05_services.md`](./05_services.md)

## 🕐 When to Use DDD

- When working with complex business rules or domains  
- When collaboration between developers and domain experts is essential  
- When clarity and maintainability of domain logic are a priority  

## ✅ Benefits of DDD

- Better alignment with business goals  
- Clearer domain models  
- Encourages modular, testable, and decoupled architecture
